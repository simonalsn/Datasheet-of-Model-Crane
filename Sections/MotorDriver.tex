\section{Motor driver}
Escon 50/5 motor drivers are used on the x- and y-axis. These are controlled by pulling the the reset pin high, thereby enabling the motor drivers. The speed of the motors are controlled by a PWM signal with a frequency between \SI{5}{kHz} and \SI{10}{kHz} and a duty cycle between \SI{10}{\percent} and \SI{90}{\percent}. A duty cycle below \SI{50}{\percent} will result in the trolley moving to the left and a duty cycle above \SI{50}{\percent} will result in the trolley moving to the right. The motor drivers has logic 0 below \SI{1}{\volt}, a logic 1 above \SI{2.4}{\volt} and a maximal input voltage of \SI{36}{\volt}.The motor drivers can be reconfigured in software using the USB-B connectors on the front panel if another configuration is needed.
